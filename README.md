# Boring-in-the-Deep

This is our submission for the Ludum Dare 48 gamejam. You can view the submission [here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/boring-in-the-deep).

Get into the shoes of the brave adventurer, writer, and *gambler*, **Phileas Fogg**. This time our shrewd protagonist has made another ludicrous bet; to **reach the center of the earth** and return to tell the tale.
**And all bets are off!**

**Note**: All audio and visual assets were made solely by us.  
That includes **music**, **sfx** (...in a bathroom...with a shitty cell phone microphone...it was glorious), and of course **the sprites** (carpal tunnel yaay)
